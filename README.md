** Explanation **

I tried to mimic Netflix's UI as much as I could, while still implementing the required functionalities for the app. 

I decided to add a carousel to the list of available categories for ensuring user interactivity, in addition to allowing users to browse by all available genres.

I used React because of its numerous benefits, including fast rendering, easy-to-follow structure, and its use of reusable components.

This, coupled with the Redux architecture allowed me to save and pertain my "state," or stored information to only be accessible to the components that needed them, enabling a "single source of truth." 

Axios is a very browser compatible HTTP client, which is why I used it.

I used Styled Components because of its flexibility and it allows for faster development.
